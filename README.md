# Chronometer for FPGA chip

####Objective
Develop a chronometer (timer) in VHDL for a FPGA chip.

####Implementation
The chronometer is divised in 4 major modules :
- counter
- memory : store the current value of the timer
- display with 7-segment display
- command circuit : managing the two buttons as a real professional chronometer (with start, pause, turn counter)
